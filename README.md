## Gompei's Gear
This is a simple web application that I made that consists of two parts: a form that the user can submit on one page, and the ability to view/change orders on the other page. The pages as a whole made good use of css styling and the flex display method. To use the application simply fill out the form and click submit. If you want to see the other page simply click the orders link. On the order's page simply click the home link to get back to the home page. To update an entry simply click the update button on the right of the information you want to update, then click save to save the updated information, discard changes to discard any changes in the current window, or delete order to delete the order from the table.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: 
  - I created a two-page app that provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data.
  - The first page contains the form and links to the second page. It sends data to the server whenever a form is submitted
  - The second page contains the table to display the data currently in the server. Whenever the page is loaded it gets the most up-to-date data and fills the table

- **Tech Achievement 2**:
  - I allowed for data to be created and deleted on the server 
  - The second page also contains buttons that are generated when the table generates that allow for the page to switch into the updating menu 
  - In this menu the user has the options to be able to update one entry at a time in the table; then they have the option to save te changes, discard them, or delete the entry as a whole 
  - Whenever changes are made to the data in the server on the display page (after the update menu), the page changes its current data to reflect the new data

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
   - Study Design:
    - I conducted a study on my UI in order to evaluate the practicality
    - I asked the user to complete 3 simple tasks: create an order, change the name listed on any order, and delete an order
    - I listed down feedback that the user gave me during, and after they completed the tasks
  
  - Study Participants:
    - I invited Tien Nguyen to participate
  
  - Study Results:
    - The users had the following issues with the interface:
      - They expected there to be an "update" button in the update menu
      - They though the buttons in the update menu should have more space between them and the text entries
      - They would prefer the buttons to be colored in the update menu
      
    - Some of the comments that I found surprising were:
      - I thought having a "save changes to order" button would server the same functionality
      
    - I think I can incorporate their feedback by doing:
      - I will increase the spacing between the text entries and the buttons in the update menu
      - Adding the requested colors to the buttons
