- **Note**: render doesn't load the page in properly sometimes so it needs a couple refreshes


The web app contains a game wishlist which can track what games you might want, their name, reviews, and price.
It will tell you the total price of all games in the list and the average game price. The css is just a simple grey/white style, 
but the buttons change size and color when hovered, indicating they are interactable. The positioning is central, the derived field
being at the bottom to be more intuitive. There is also one initial example value in the data.
